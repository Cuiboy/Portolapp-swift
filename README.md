This is a project based in Swift, meaning that you must install Xcode running on MacOS X, and initialize Cocoapods.\
After pulling from the repository, run ```
pod install ```

in the command line of your choice to install needed dependencies.

After fixing any errors, run the app on the iOS simulator.
